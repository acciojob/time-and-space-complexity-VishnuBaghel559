	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as time taken by a program t run and complete the given task. as a programmer, your goal should to reduce the time. complexity of the code by optimizzing it and make it more efficient. </p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a way to measure how much extra memory (space) an algorithm uses in relation to the size of the input. We usually express space complexity using Big O notation, like O(1), O(n)</p>
